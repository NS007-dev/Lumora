This project was originally intended to be a team effort, I ended up completing it on my own as during the early initial stages of this competition, my supposed team-mate decided not to be a part of this years technovation, due to needing to focus on priorities elsewhere. 

While completing this all solo came with its challenges—managing everything from planning and development to design and pitching—I embraced the experience as an opportunity to grow. 

Taking on the full process solo taught me so much about resilience, creativity, and problem-solving, and I’m incredibly proud of what I was able to build.
